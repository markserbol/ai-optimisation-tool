# Demo Script - AI Visibility Optimisation Tool

**Estimated Duration:** 3-5 minutes

---

## Introduction (30 seconds)

**SHOW:** Homepage with the URL input form

**SAY:**
> "This is the AI Visibility Optimisation tool. It analyzes hotel websites to identify issues that reduce how well AI systems like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI can understand and recommend the property.
>
> Unlike traditional SEO audits, this focuses specifically on content extractability and clarity for AI engines."

---

## Starting an Analysis (30 seconds)

**SHOW:** Type a hotel URL into the input field

**SAY:**
> "To start, I simply enter the hotel's website URL. The system will automatically crawl multiple pages - the homepage, rooms, amenities, and other public pages."

---

## Processing State (20 seconds)

**SHOW:** The progress indicator while crawling/analyzing

**SAY:**
> "Here you can see the progress - it's currently crawling the website. Once that's done, it will analyze the content using an LLM to generate specific, actionable suggestions."

---

## Results Overview (45 seconds)

**SHOW:** The completed analysis with summary cards

**SAY:**
> "Once complete, we get a summary dashboard. In this example, the system crawled [X] pages and found [Y] total suggestions.
>
> The suggestions are prioritized by severity - high priority issues that significantly impact AI understanding, medium priority for moderate impact, and low priority for minor improvements."

---

## Suggestion Categories (1-2 minutes)

**SHOW:** Click through the category tabs

**SAY:**
> "Suggestions are organized into five categories based on what matters for AI visibility:"

### Content Clarity Tab
**SAY:**
> "Content Clarity identifies ambiguous facts, marketing fluff without concrete details, and mixed intents that confuse AI systems."

**ACTION:** Show an example suggestion

**SAY:**
> "For example, this suggestion highlights [read the issue title]. It explains why this matters for AI - [read the why]. And provides a specific fix - [read the fix]."

**ACTION:** Click the page URL link on the suggestion card

**SAY:**
> "We can verify this by clicking through to the actual page. Here you can see the text the AI identified - [point to the problematic text on the website]. This is exactly what the suggestion is referring to, and you can see why it would be confusing for an AI trying to extract clear facts."

**ACTION:** Return to the analysis tab

### Structured Data Tab
**SAY:**
> "Structured Data shows opportunities for Schema.org markup that helps AI systems extract information more reliably."

### Consistency Tab
**SAY:**
> "Internal Consistency catches conflicting facts across pages - like different room counts or amenity descriptions - which can cause AI to hallucinate or provide incorrect information."

### Other Tabs (briefly)
**SAY:**
> "We also have Page Coverage for missing content gaps, and Structural Signals for information that's buried or poorly labeled."

## History Feature (15 seconds)

**SHOW:** Click "View past analyses" link, show history page

## Tips for Recording

1. **Use a real hotel website** - Pick one with a variety of content (rooms, amenities, dining, etc.)
2. **Have a completed analysis ready** - You can start one before recording and show the completed results to save time
3. **Zoom in** on the browser (Cmd/Ctrl + Plus) so text is readable
4. **Pause briefly** on each suggestion to let viewers read it
5. **Keep it conversational** - The script is a guide, not a teleprompter

## Sample Hotels to Demo

- A boutique hotel with its own website
- A small hotel chain property page
- Any hotel with a dedicated website (not just an OTA listing)
