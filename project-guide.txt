Visaible Engineering Pilot Project
Automated AI Visibility Optimisation Suggestions
Engagement type: Paid pilot project
Audience: Software / AI Engineer
Delivery: Working prototype
Demo: Local demo to Sam (screen share or local run)
Deployment: Not required
Objective
Build a prototype system that:
● Analyses a hotel’s website (ideally all public pages)
● Identifies issues that reduce AI visibility, recommendation likelihood, or factual
accuracy
● Produces clear, actionable optimisation suggestions to improve the hotel
website so that AI engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini) more accurately
understand, surface, and recommend the property
This is not a traditional SEO audit.
The focus is on how AI systems read, summarise, and reason about hotel websites.
Context
Visaible helps hotels understand and improve how they appear in AI-generated answers.
AI engines are increasingly the discovery and recommendation layer for hotels.
They rely on:
● Content clarity and structure
● Consistency of facts across pages
● Structured data and machine-readable signals
● How information is organised for extraction and reasoning
This pilot tests your ability to translate these concepts into working software.
Instructions and Assumptions
The instructions in this brief are intentionally high-level and partially vague.
This is deliberate.
Part of the evaluation is to assess:
● The assumptions you make
● How you scope an ambiguous problem
● How you balance completeness versus practicality
If something is unclear:
● Make a reasonable assumption
● State it explicitly
● Proceed
Do not wait for perfect requirements.
Input
The system should accept:
● A hotel website URL
The system should:
● Crawl and analyse multiple pages (e.g. homepage, rooms, amenities, offers, blog)
● Work on publicly accessible pages only
You may assume:
● English-language content
● No authentication
● No need to perfectly handle JavaScript-heavy rendering
Output
The system should output a structured list of optimisation suggestions.
Each suggestion must clearly explain:
● What the issue is
● Why it matters for AI engines
● What should be changed
Example (illustrative only):
Issue: Swimming Pool amenity unclear across pages - one page mentions there
is a pool, another page mentions there is only a Spa
Why it matters: AI models frequently hallucinate amenities when signals conflict
Suggested fix: Add an explicit amenities section with yes/no attributes and
reinforce via structured data
Suggestions must be specific and actionable, not generic.
Required Suggestion Categories
Your system should aim to generate suggestions across at least the following
areas. 1. Content Clarity and Structure
● Ambiguous or missing hotel facts
● Marketing copy without factual anchors
● Pages that mix multiple intents
● Lack of concise, answer-friendly sections
2. Page Coverage and Gaps
● Important hotel topics not clearly covered (e.g. details on types of hotel rooms
available)
● Pages that should exist but do not
● Over-reliance on vague experiential language
3. Structured Data and Machine Readability
● Missing or incomplete schema opportunities
● Hotel attributes that should be explicit for AI
● Conflicts between visible content and structured data
4. Internal Consistency
● Conflicting facts across pages
● Inconsistent naming of rooms or amenities
● Location ambiguity (districts, landmarks, proximity)
5. Structural Signals That Reduce AI Clarity
● Important facts buried deep in pages
● Poorly labelled sections
● Dense text blocks that obscure key information
This is not a UI or design critique.
It is about extractability and clarity for AI systems.
Background: What Makes a Website Optimised for AI
For this project, an AI-optimised hotel website is one that allows AI systems to easily
extract, reconcile, and trust factual information about the property.
AI engines do not interpret visual design or brand tone like humans. They perform best when
information is explicit, structured, consistent, and easy to extract.
Websites that perform well in AI answers typically:
● State important facts explicitly
● Separate experiential language from factual information
● Use clear sections aligned to common user questions
● Reinforce the same facts consistently across pages
● Present key details in lists, tables, summaries, or structured data
The goal is extractability, not aesthetics.
For this project:
● You do not need to assess visual design quality
● You should flag structural or content patterns that:
○ Obscure key facts
○ Create ambiguity
○ Increase the likelihood of AI misinterpretation
Independent Research
We have provided high-level guidance above in the Background: What Makes a Website
Optimised for AI section.
In addition to this, you are encouraged to do your own research on what makes a website
perform well in AI-generated answers.
This may include (but is not limited to):
● How LLMs extract and summarise web content
● How retrieval-augmented systems select and weight sources
● Patterns that reduce hallucinations or increase confidence
● Public guidance, experiments, or case studies related to AI search and AI answers
We are interested in how you apply your understanding, not whether you follow a
prescribed framework.
AI-Powered Suggestions (Requirement)
The optimisation suggestions produced by the system must be AI-powered.
You may:
● Use one or more LLMs to analyse page content
● Combine AI reasoning with lightweight rules or checks
● Use AI to summarise, compare, and reason across pages
We are not evaluating prompt sophistication.
We are evaluating whether AI is used appropriately and efficiently to generate useful
optimisation suggestions.
Technical Expectations
You may choose:
● Any language or framework (Typescript is preferred with a simple database)
● Any crawling or parsing approach
● Any AI models
The prototype should demonstrate:
● Multi-page analysis
● Non-generic, reasoned suggestions
● An attractive front-end is required to easily step through the application
You do not need to:
● Deploy to production
● Handle scale or edge cases
Code quality matters less than clarity of thinking and output usefulness.
Helpful Tools and APIs (Optional)
You may use any tools you find appropriate.
The following API may be helpful:
● Firecrawl – for crawling and extracting content across all pages of a website
Use is optional and not required.
Demo Requirements
When ready, you will:
● Demo the system to Sam
● Walk through:
○ Inputting a hotel URL
○ Pages analysed
○ Suggestions generated
○ How suggestions map to AI visibility improvements
A screen share or local run is sufficient.
What We Are Evaluating
We will evaluate:
● How you reason about AI interpretation of websites ●
The quality and specificity of optimisation suggestions ●
System design decisions
● Practical usefulness for real hotels
● How you handle ambiguity
